**Genderify** is an open-source project aimed at supporting gender-inclusive language in digital documents. The goal of
the project is to provide a simple and effective way to offer gender-neutral alternatives for commonly used terms. By
using Genderify, the visibility of all genders in communication is increased, and inclusive language is promoted.

Gender-inclusive language is a crucial step in promoting gender equality in society. Many terms in the German language
are gender-specific and do not reflect the diversity of gender identities. Therefore, it is essential to adapt the
language to address all individuals. By using gender-inclusive language, inclusivity is promoted, ensuring that all
genders are addressed, creating visibility and a sense of belonging.

This tool only suggests gender-neutral alternatives for german terms. Grammatical rules and contexts are not considered!
When using a gender-neutral alternative, it may happen that the sentence structure is no longer correct. No distinction
is made between singular and plural forms with the same spelling. The vocabulary provided is not exhaustive. If there
are errors or suggestions for improvement, they can be submitted in
an [issue](https://github.com/drachenpapa/genderify/issues/new/choose) or a pull request. Contributions are welcome!
